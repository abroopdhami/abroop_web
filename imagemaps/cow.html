        Cow Chop is a channel created by James (UberHaxorNova) and Aleks (ImmortalHD) on the 29th of February, 2016. Their first upload, "FIRST VIDEO", was uploaded on the 1st of April. The channel's main topic is couch gaming co-op; though, they also produce sketches, vlogs, and various non-gaming series.

        The name Cow Chop is said to come from Couch Co-Op, Couch Op, Cow Chop. When asked "Why cows?" James responded with "Why not? It goes with the name."

        The initial idea for Cow Chop was made back in 2014 according to James. While he was still with the Creatures, James hinted towards the creation of Cow Chop during James Hub 3.0 without Aleks' consent.
