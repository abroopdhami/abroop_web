         The Cow Chop TV podcast format is unique as most podcasts are filmed in a built set.
        A CCTV podcast is uploaded each week, each in a different location.
        There is "NO MEME-ING ALLOWED", meaning that everyone on CCTV has to tell the actual truth and not embellish or lie to a story. This is in order to have the real story and see the crew at their most normal states (Not putting on a character for entertainment purposes).

        At the bottom of the description in each Cow Chop video there are two phrases, both in a different language that are sometimes related to that video. | The following are the translations for each video.
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>"Morning winds, The shaded bay, And mirrored in the lake, The ripening fruit. "</li>
            <li>"And on the pedestal is the writing: My name is Osymandias, king of all kings: Behold my works, Might'ge, and tremble!"</li>
            <li>" A picture of Dusky Grame, Stretching around the debris endless, bare, monotonous."</li>
        </ul>
