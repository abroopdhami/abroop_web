            <font face="Impact" size="3" ><a href="http://www.bmthofficial.com/">Bring Me the Horizon</a></font>, often known by the acronym <font face="Impact" size="3" ><a href="https://twitter.com/olobersyko">BMTH</a></font>, are a British rock band from Sheffield, South Yorkshire. Formed in 2004, the group currently consists of vocalist Oliver Sykes, guitarist Lee Malia, bassist Matt Kean, drummer Matt Nicholls and keyboardist Jordan Fish. They are signed to RCA Records globally and Columbia Records exclusively in the United States. The style of their early work, including their debut album Count Your Blessings, has primarily been described as deathcore<sup>(A bit too hardcore for me)</sup>, but they started to adopt a more eclectic style of metalcore on subsequent albums. Furthermore, their latest album That's the Spirit marked a shift in their sound to less aggressive rock music styles.

Upon release, the album was met with great polarisation amongst the public and critical disdain. The band began to break away from their controversial sound with Suicide Season <sub>(2008)</sub>, which proved to be a creative, critical and commercial turning point for the band. Bring Me the Horizon then released their third album There Is a Hell, Believe Me I've Seen It. There Is a Heaven, Let's Keep It a Secret<sub>(2010)</sub>, propelling them to greater international fame, whilst incorporating influences from classical, electronica and pop. Their major label debut, Sempiternal <sub>(2013)</sub> achieved Gold certification in Australia (35,000) and Silver in the United Kingdom (60,000). That's the Spirit (2015) debuted at number two in the UK Albums Chart and the US Billboard 200. Aside from these five albums, they have also released two extended plays and two live albums. They have received four Kerrang! Awards, including two for Best British Band and one for Best Live Band.</p>

        You don't have to lie, I know exactly where you've been

        Here the Voice of the song seems to be talking somebody who is still addicted to recreational drugs.

    <p>
        <b>
        No we're not on the level, you're just off your face
        <br>
        It's not a state of mind no, your head's just in a state
        <br>
        I may be on the outside, but you're empty within
        <br>
        It's getting kind of old now, I think it's time to pack it in

        He is denying that the drug is putting them on some kind of other spiritual level. Instead, he is accepting the reality of the situation of them being off their face. Although you may be sober and not be enjoying the high of the drug, you are least are not emotionally empty like this addict. They are suggesting the addict to stop what they are doing to get clean by telling them to “pack in” their addiction history and inner suffering that caused the drug intake in the first place as a form of assurance.

        <b>
        Don't call it a party 'cause it never stops
        <br>
        Now one is too many, but it's never enough
        <br>
        Don't tell me you're happy 'cause this isn't love
        <br>
        So be careful what you wish for
        <br>

        Warning the addict or person under the influence that what they are doing isnt just for a party or a one night thing it turns into an addiction that will go on forever. Although the drug abuser may think he is happy while he is on drugs, he is actually miserable in reality. The drugs can only hide hurt and depression for so long, and it definitely comes with a cost. True happiness and love comes from defeating or embracing your demons rather than escaping them temporarily by abusing.

        They know the addict is trying to hold onto heaven (trying to be spiritual and good) by way of addiction but is so close to breaking down mentally that they are barely hanging.

    Oli (lead singer) is warning the addict or person under the influence that what they are doing is not just for a party, or a one night thing, it turns into an addiction that will go on forever. Although the drug abuser may think he is happy while he is on drugs, he is actually miserable in reality. The drugs can only hide hurt and depression for so long, and it definitely comes with a cost. True happiness and love comes from defeating or embracing your demons rather than escaping them temporarily by abusing they also refer  to how the actions you make as an individual impact the way that people around you see you. For example, Oli (lead singer) admitted that he was addicted to Ketamine. At the APMAs 2014 he, admitting to the entire audience, none of whom knew of his addiction, said, My band wanted to kill me, my parents wanted to kill me, my brother wanted to kill me. He then admitted, I went to rehab for a month, and you guys were sending me texts and emails. When I got out of that rehab, I didn’t want to scream anymore, I wanted to sing from the top of my lungs.
