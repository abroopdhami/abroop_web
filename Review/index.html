            <font face="Impact" size="3" ><a href="http://www.bmthofficial.com/">Bring Me the Horizon</a></font>, often known by the acronym <font face="Impact" size="3" ><a href="https://twitter.com/olobersyko">BMTH</a></font>, are a British rock band from Sheffield, South Yorkshire. Formed in 2004, the group currently consists of vocalist Oliver Sykes, guitarist Lee Malia, bassist Matt Kean, drummer Matt Nicholls and keyboardist Jordan Fish. They are signed to RCA Records globally and Columbia Records exclusively in the United States. The style of their early work, including their debut album Count Your Blessings, has primarily been described as deathcore<sup>(A bit too hardcore for me)</sup>, but they started to adopt a more eclectic style of metalcore on subsequent albums. Furthermore, their latest album That's the Spirit marked a shift in their sound to less aggressive rock music styles.

            <font face="Impact" size="3" ><a href="https://www.horizonsupply.co/">Bring Me the Horizon</a></font> released their debut album Count Your Blessings in <sub>2006</sub>. Upon release, the album was met with great polarisation amongst the public and critical disdain. The band began to break away from their controversial sound with Suicide Season <sub>(2008)</sub>, which proved to be a creative, critical and commercial turning point for the band. Bring Me the Horizon then released their third album There Is a Hell, Believe Me I've Seen It. There Is a Heaven, Let's Keep It a Secret<sub>(2010)</sub>, propelling them to greater international fame, whilst incorporating influences from classical, electronica and pop. Their major label debut, Sempiternal <sub>(2013)</sub> achieved Gold certification in Australia (35,000) and Silver in the United Kingdom (60,000). That's the Spirit (2015) debuted at number two in the UK Albums Chart and the US Billboard 200. Aside from these five albums, they have also released two extended plays and two live albums. They have received four Kerrang! Awards, including two for Best British Band and one for Best Live Band.</p>

   <p><b>[Verse 1]</b></p>
    <p style="width:250px;">
        You don't have to lie, I know exactly where you've been
        'Cause you're chewing off my ear while you're chewing on your chin
    </p>

    <p>[Pre-Chorus]</p>
    <p style="width:250px;">
        No we're not on the level, you're just off your face
        It's not a state of mind no, your head's just in a state
        I may be on the outside, but you're empty within
        It's getting kind of old now, I think it's time to pack it in
</p>

    <p><b>[Chorus]</b></p>
    <p style="width:250px;">
        Don't call it a party 'cause it never stops
        Now one is too many, but it's never enough
        Don't tell me you're happy 'cause this isn't love
        So be careful what you wish for
        So be careful what you wish for
</p>

    <p><b>[Verse 2]</b></p>
    <p style="width:250px;">
        Who you trying to fool? You know you're in over your head
        'Cause you're holding onto heaven, but you're hanging by a thread
</p>

    <p><b>[Pre Chorus]</b></p>
    <p style="width:250px;">
        No we're not on the level, you're just off your face
        It's not a state of mind no, your head's just in a state
        I may be on the outside, but you're empty within
        It's getting kind of old now, I think it's time to pack it in

    <p><b>[Chorus]</b></p>
    <p style="width:250px;">
        Don't call it a party 'cause it never stops
        Now one is too many, but it's never enough
        Don't tell me you're happy 'cause this isn't love
        So be careful what you wish for
        So be careful what you wish for
        (Oh no)
        Don't call it a party 'cause it never stops
        Now one is too many, but it's never enough
        Don't tell me you're happy 'cause this isn't love
        So be careful what you wish for
        Don't call it a party 'cause it never stops
        Now one is too many, but it's never enough
        Don't tell me you're happy 'cause this isn't love
        So be careful what you wish for
        Don't call it a party 'cause it never stops
        Now one is too many, but it's never enough
        Don't tell me you're happy 'cause this isn't love
        So be careful what you wish for
