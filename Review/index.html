            <font face="Impact" size="3" ><a href="http://www.bmthofficial.com/">Bring Me the Horizon</a></font>, often known by the acronym <font face="Impact" size="3" ><a href="https://twitter.com/olobersyko">BMTH</a></font>, are a British rock band from Sheffield, South Yorkshire. Formed in 2004, the group currently consists of vocalist Oliver Sykes, guitarist Lee Malia, bassist Matt Kean, drummer Matt Nicholls and keyboardist Jordan Fish. They are signed to RCA Records globally and Columbia Records exclusively in the United States. The style of their early work, including their debut album Count Your Blessings, has primarily been described as deathcore, but they started to adopt a more eclectic style of metalcore on subsequent albums. Furthermore, their latest album That's the Spirit marked a shift in their sound to less aggressive rock music styles.
